    Sometimes a little help can make things even better. Maybe while Solving a math function or making a presentation for your work,
    you can use this project everywhere you need. And I believe the best way to understand data is by making a drawing or something that can visually represent the information. 
    If I'm comparing two or three objects, in this case, it is easy. But think about more data, technology can save your time and make that work easy for you.
    Some graphs in this application are not only for numbers, so play with it a little bit. You will catch the idea. I just added the basic and important functionality.
    If you need to add more (Maybe capture the graph and download it ... etc) you are permitted to do. But don't use it for any commercial reason without permission. 
    And thank you for using it.</p>
